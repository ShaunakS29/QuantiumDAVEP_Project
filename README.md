**Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on Forage**

This project is based on the [Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on Forage] (https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv/Data%20Analytics?ref=tvikfrytzCFR8k4Gy).

I analysed data relating to the transactions relating to sales of different brands of chips as well as the type of purchasing customers. As part of the task I explored the different features like month of sale, chips brands, stores and customer segment to understand their interrelation with the sales amount. I also explored the impact of trials of new layout at specific stores by analysing the monthly data of those particular stores during the trial period.

The analysis report has been provided in this link [QAVEP report.pdf](https://github.com/ShaunakS29/QuantiumDAVEP_Project/files/9711440/QAVEP.report.pdf)
