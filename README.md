# QuantiumDAVEP_Project
**Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on Forage**

This project is based on the [Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on Forage] (https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv/Data%20Analytics?ref=tvikfrytzCFR8k4Gy).

I analysed data relating to the transactions relating to sales of different brands of chips as well as the type of purchasing customers. As part of the task I explored the different features like month of sale, chips brands, stores and customer segment to understand their interrelation with the sales amount. I also explored the impact of trials of new layout at specific stores by analysing the monthly data of those particular stores during the trial period.
